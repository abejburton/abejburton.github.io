#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Data Science master's student at [UChicago MSCAPP](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp) with an emphasis in urban policy. I am focused on using data to create more `equitable and sustainable cities`. I'm interested in how `transportation`, `walkability`, and `zoning` can create a higher quality of life in cities.

My undergraduate background is in economics and statistics. In graduate school I'm merging the tools of causal inference with machine learning and a broader data science skillset to conduct research and build data applications that provide insight into the things I care about.
