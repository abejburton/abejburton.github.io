Data Science master's student at [UChicago MSCAPP](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp) with an emphasis in urban policy. I'm experienced combining machine learning and causal inference techniques to extract insights from data.

I interested in using data to create more `equitable and sustainable cities`. I care about using `transportation`, `walkability`, `zoning`, and `tax policy` to create a higher quality of life in cities.

My undergraduate background is in economics and statistics. In graduate school I'm merging the tools of econometrics with machine learning and a broader data science skillset to conduct research and build data applications that provide insight into the things I care about.
